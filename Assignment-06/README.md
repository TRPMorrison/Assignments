## Homework

#### Part 1

Download the included `functions.js` you will find a list of questions. Each question describes a function you need to create. Also make sure your code has no issues when run through **JS Hint**.


#### Part 2

1. Read over this [style guide](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
2. Create a `sass` branch of Surf & Paddle
3. Setup a `.scss` file in that branch and convert your project to using SASS
4. Follow the above style guide
5. There should not be any ID's in your CSS.
6. All colors, font families, fixed width sizes etc should be in variables.
7. Any reusable rules should be converted to mixins
8. Make sure to use nesting, but don't go too deep

## Deliverables

When you are done with the above, you should merge your `sass` branch into your `master` and `gh-pages` branches. Push all branches to github.

When you are complete, please comment on the open issue with a link to your GH Pages for this project as well as a link to the SASS file `.scss` you used for this project.

Also include a link to your `functions.js` file. You should create a seperate repo for this.
