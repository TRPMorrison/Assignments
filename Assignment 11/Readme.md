___This homework is due by 8am, on 05/27/15___


For this assignment, you will be broken up into pairs (and one group of 3) and will be required to use the style of [Pair Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) in order to complete the assignment.

## Groups

| Person [A] | Person [B] | Person [C] |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Leslie     | Danny      | Mike       |
| Harold     | Meade      |            |
| Jim        | Justin     |            |
| Joe        | Jamie      |            |
| Trinidad   | Princess   |            |
| Bobby      | Kelley     |            |
| Kishan     | Max        |            | 
| Kalif      | Nick       |            | 
| Vi         | Christian  |            |


## Fork / Pull Requests

- One of you (Person [A]) will create the project locally and on github
- The other person (Person [B]) will `fork` the repo and pull down their copy locally
- Once you are both done with the work, the second person will initiate a `pull request` to get all 4 problems done.


## Normal Mode

- Work through the attached `exercises.js` file and write the functions that it asks. 
  - The first 2 will be done by person [A] while the other person [B] looks on and helps without typing. 
  - Then person [B] will then open up their `forked` version and will work through the remaining 2 problems while person [A] will look on and help without typing.

### Deliverables

- Person [A] will accept the pull request and both people will post a link to that repo in the Issue assigned to them and will close that assignment out.
