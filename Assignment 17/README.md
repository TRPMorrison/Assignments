* __JavaScript Koans__

The javascript koans are your path to enlightenment in JavaScript. They are a great review into many of the concepts we have learned and will introduce you to unit tests in JavaScript.

## Objectives

    * Head over [here](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans) & Fork the project
    * Delete the existing `gh-pages` branch (do this on github)
    * Clone down your fork of it
    * Create a new `gh-pages` branch from master
    * Open the test suite at `KoansRunner.html`
    * Make all 53 Koans pass
    * Make sure to commit after each section so you don't loose any work

  * __Note:__ The underscore version included in `lib/underscore-min.js` is 4 years old and missing a lot of the current features. I went through and solved it using the old underscore version that it comes with. However, feel free to update it to the newer underscore.


### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should have a basic understanding of unit tests, arrays, objects, functions, & higher order functions (functional style programming).

## Details

### Deliverables

* A link to your koans repo with all of the 53 koans passing.
