Refactor your Todo  application to utilize javascript constructors. Make a TodoItem constructor that has prototype methods for marking the item as complete and determining if the item is complete.

## Objectives

- Create a branch called `prototype` on your original TodoItem repo 
- Refactor your `prototype` branch to use at least 1 prototype
- Make sure that when you mark one instance of todo item as complete it does not effect others.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand the relationship between objects, prototypes and constructors.
