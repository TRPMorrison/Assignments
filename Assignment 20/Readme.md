## Description

Create a single page application using Backbone. This will be fairly similar to your contact list except it will be a list of pictures of your family/friends and when you click on a picture it will provide you with more information about them. It could be as simple as their name, age and favorite color or it can be as complex as you decide to make it.

## Normal Model

- On the "home" page or "/", it should simple show some friends/familes.
- When you click on any picture, it will `route` you to a page with more information about that person

## Deliverables

- A deployed URL to Divshot
- A link to your repository
- No JSHint errors
