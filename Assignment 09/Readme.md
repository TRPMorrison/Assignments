## Normal Mode

### Part 1
* Build a jQuery Accordion WITHOUT using `slideUp`, `slideDown`, or `slideToggle`. Hint: use `addClass` & `removeClass`.
* Only CSS3 transitions allowed. It should work for 2 or more sections.
* Use the image below as an example

### Part 2
Read through the jQuery API documentation to see all the methods that are available.
- http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
- http://api.jquery.com/category/attributes/
- http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/


## Deliverables

1. Comment with a link to Github Pages on the Issue that is assigned to you.


## Hard Mode

As further practice with JS Arrays, loops and functions, rebuild the following methods using only a `for` loop.

- `map()`
- `reduce()`
- `filter()`
